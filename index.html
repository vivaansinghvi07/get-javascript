                Based on the popular game <a href = "https://play2048.co">2048</a>, 
                the objective of this game is to combine various programming languages to obtain JavaScript!
                The game should be mechanically the same as the original.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can move with the arrow keys or WASD, but be careful: making any move 
                (whether possible or not) adds a version of C to the board!
